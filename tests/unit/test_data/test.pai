# This is a comprehensive test file for the PAI language
# It tests various language features including:
# - Variable assignment
# - Conditional statements
# - Function definitions and calls
# - Recursion
# - Variable scoping
# - Print statements

# Basic variable assignments with different types
set count to 0
set message to "Test started"
set pi to 3
set is_active to true

# Basic print statements
print message
print "Value of count: "
print count
print "PI equals: "
print pi

# Conditional statement with otherwise block
when count = 0 {
    print "Count is zero"
    set count to count + 1
} otherwise {
    print "Count is not zero"
}

print "After first check count equals: "
print count

# Another conditional with variable modification
when count > 5 {
    print "Count is greater than 5"
} otherwise {
    print "Count is less than or equal to 5"
    set count to count + 5
}

print "After second check count equals: "
print count

# Function definition that uses a global variable

# Function with conditional logic

# Function calls and storing results
set radius to 5

print area

find_max(10, 7)

# Testing recursion

# Another recursive function
